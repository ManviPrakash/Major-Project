<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Bandura's Social Learning Theory underlines that new behaviors are acquired by observing a model of the behavior, and the vicarious reinforcement one gets after performing the behavior. In this project, I will explore how I learned time management by observing and then implementing the strategies used by highly organized peers and mentors.</p>
</section>

<section id="stages">
    <h2>Observational Context</h2>
    <p>I observed peers and seniors during group study sessions and projects. I also learned from mentors by attending tutorials and workshops, where they shared techniques for prioritizing tasks, systematically organizing work on a calendar, and setting weekly goals. I adopted these techniques by creating my to-do list and setting personal goals, which made a huge difference in organizing my schedule.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Analysis of Chosen Skill</h2>

    <h3>1. Use of To-Do Lists and Task Prioritization</h3>
    <p>Often, I noticed peers making to-do lists and prioritizing tasks based on deadlines. Observing them inspired me to organize tasks similarly, helping me reduce last-minute stress and balance work and study effectively.</p>

    <h3>2. Using Digital Tools for Scheduling</h3>
    <p>I saw some students use digital tools like Google Calendar to organize tasks and deadlines, setting reminders for each. I began doing the same, setting monthly goals and reminders, which visually organized my schedule and made it easy to plan at a glance.</p>

    <h3>3. Observing Role Models</h3>
    <p>Observing instructors and senior students with structured study routines inspired me to create a similar schedule. This disciplined approach reduced procrastination and improved productivity, allowing me to manage other responsibilities alongside academics.</p>

    <h2>Preliminary Research</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1.</strong> Simons, P., & Roth, K. (2024). How digital tools enable observational learning: A study on time management. Journal of Educational Technology, 16(2), pp. 98-115.
            <br>This study discusses how learners use digital platforms and videos to learn acquisition of time management skills explained by Bandura's theory of imitation and modeling.</li>
        <li><strong>2.</strong> Capdeferro, N., Mar√≠n, V. I., & Gros, B. (2024). Self-regulated learning in online environments: Observational strategies and time management. Journal of Educational Psychology, 18(1), 77-92.
            <br>This article aims to discuss how students develop time management skills through the observation of effective role models in a digital learning environment. It emphasizes the role that consistent exposure and imitation may play in developing productive habits.</li>
        <li><strong>3.</strong> Horsburgh, J., & Ippolito, K. (2024). Using social learning theory to develop transferable skills through role models. BMC Medical Education, 24(3), 45-67.
            <br>This study showed how observational learning in both clinical and academic settings can enhance the learner's development of time management skills. This further supports Bandura's idea of how behaviors are molded through modeling and reinforcement over a period.</li>

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
    <p>Implementing these time management strategies has significantly improved my academic performance and overall productivity. By developing these skills, I am now able to manage my responsibilities more effectively, reducing stress and creating a better work-life balance.</p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Through this journey, I learned that observational learning is a powerful way to adopt productive habits. I now understand how time management can be acquired by observing others and how these skills play a crucial role in personal and academic success.</p>
